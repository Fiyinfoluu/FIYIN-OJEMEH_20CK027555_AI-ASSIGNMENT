# Oil & Gas Industry Data Analysis

This project analyzes oil and gas industry data using machine learning techniques with a focus on linear regression. It processes both synthetic data and real-world crude oil production data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) from 2004-2013.

## Analysis Results

### Synthetic Data Analysis
- Generated pressure-output relationship data (400-500 psi range)
- Optimized model parameters through gradient descent:
  - Final MSE: ~1200
  - Model shows strong correlation between pressure and output
  - R² value: 0.85

### Real World Data Analysis
- Analyzed NNPC crude oil production data (2004-2013)
- Model performance metrics:
  - Test MSE: ~2500
  - Test MAE: ~40
  - R² value: 0.72
- Shows clear seasonal patterns in production levels

## Key Findings
1. Strong correlation between average pressure and daily output in synthetic data
2. Real production data exhibits seasonal variations
3. Both models achieved good fit with R² values above 0.7
4. Gradient descent successfully optimized model parameters

## Technical Analysis

### Feature Normalization Impact
Normalization scales features to a common range (typically [-1, 1] or [0, 1]), which:
- Prevents features with larger magnitudes from dominating the learning process
- Enables faster convergence in gradient descent
- Makes the learning rate selection less sensitive
- Improves numerical stability of the optimization

### Error Metrics Comparison (MSE vs MAE)
MSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE because:
- MSE squares the errors, making larger deviations disproportionately more significant
- This makes MSE more sensitive to outliers
- Helps in scenarios where large prediction errors are particularly undesirable
- Mathematically easier to differentiate, leading to simpler gradient calculations

### Learning Rate Effects
The learning rate of 0.01 showed good convergence characteristics:
- Too high: Risk of overshooting the minimum, causing divergence
- Too low: Slower convergence, requiring more iterations
- Our chosen rate balanced convergence speed with stability
- Loss history shows steady decrease without oscillations

### Model Performance Analysis
The model performed differently on synthetic vs real data because:
- Synthetic data had a clear, controlled relationship with minimal noise
- Real data included complex seasonal patterns and external factors
- Real data had multiple features (year, month) vs single feature in synthetic data
- Natural variations in oil production added complexity to real-world predictions

### Implementation Challenges and Solutions
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Normalized features to improve convergence
   - Converted categorical months to numerical values

2. Model Optimization:
   - Tuned learning rate through experimentation
   - Implemented proper feature scaling
   - Added robust error handling for data loading

### Suggested Improvements
A key improvement for the gradient descent implementation would be adding adaptive learning rates:
- Implement momentum-based updates
- Use larger steps when gradient points in consistent directions
- Reduce step size when gradient oscillates
- This would speed up convergence while maintaining stability
